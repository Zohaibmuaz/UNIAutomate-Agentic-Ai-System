**Course Code: CS101**
**Title: Introduction to Programming**
**Credits: 3**
**Description:** This course is the foundational gateway to computer science. Students will learn the fundamentals of programming, including variables, control structures (loops, conditionals), functions, and basic data types. The primary language of instruction is Python. Emphasis is placed on problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
**Prerequisites:** None.

**Course Code: CS202**
**Title: Data Structures and Algorithms**
**Credits: 4**
**Description:** A core course that provides a comprehensive study of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and graphs. Students will also analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. This course involves significant programming assignments.
**Prerequisites:** CS101 - Introduction to Programming.

**Course Code: CS210**
**Title: Database Systems**
**Credits: 3**
**Description:** This course covers the design, theory, and implementation of database management systems (DBMS). Topics include the relational model, SQL, database design using ER diagrams, normalization, transaction management, and concurrency control. Students will complete a project involving the design and implementation of a small database application.
